The city is a complete mess, and these damn virus don't 
do anything besides attacking us! Back in my days we 
were allowed to have weapons, but you can always get one, 
I got my new bazooka in "that place", you know what place I'm talking
about aren't you?
Don't you? If you go the east and then to the south of the 
city you'll find a "space between portals" 
where you can get anything you need, whether is legal or not.
